This set of scripts runs the free-vibration analyses for 1D meshes, shown in Figures 4 and 5 of the manuscript.

The scripts are run from the run1D.m file. The specific file also includes all the input definitions (1D case considered, discretization, etc.) 

Please see the script files for further annotations and information.
